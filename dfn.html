                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>Dyslexia is a learning disorder that often goes unrecognized or is misunderstood, particularly in
                    regions like West Africa, where awareness and resources to support children with dyslexia are
                    limited.
                </p>
                <p><b>The goal:</b> to create a digital platform that supports children with dyslexia in improving their
                    literacy and learning skills in an effective and enjoyable way. Additionally, the platform will
                    provide instructors with tools to track student progress, take notes, and interact with their
                    students more effectively.
                </p>
                <p>This initiative is part of a multi-phase effort, with our team focusing on <b>Phase 2.</b> Over the
                    course of 11 weeks, we collaborated on a pro bono basis to conduct user research and usability
                    testing, gathering insights from instructors and students to evaluate the current designs, identify
                    areas for improvement, and inform future iterations.

                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>Phase 2 built on the foundational work of Phase 1, focusing on testing and iterating on design and
                    research concepts. The primary goal was to ensure that all data and insights were consistent with
                    user needs and grounded in validated research. Key tasks included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Validating Phase 1 research to refine personas, ensuring alignment with real user needs and
                        frustrations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Refining survey questions to improve clarity, inclusivity, and the quality of insights gathered.
                    </li>
                    <li>Conducting usability tests with educators and students, analyzing feedback to identify patterns
                        and key areas for improvement.
                    </li>
                    <li>Synthesizing findings from usability testing to deliver clear, prioritized insights for Phase 3
                        development.
                    </li>

                <h2>Our Process</h2>
                <p>To build a strong foundation for Phase 2, we began by validating research findings from Phase 1,
                    which included reviewing insights gathered from interviews and surveys. Each team member was
                    assigned specific claims from the existing persona created during Phase 1, and our task was to
                    validate these claims by tracing them back to the original research data.</p>
                <h3>1. Validating research and refining the persona</h3>
                <p>To build a strong foundation for Phase 2, we began by validating research findings from Phase 1,
                    which included reviewing insights gathered from interviews and surveys. Each team member was
                    assigned specific claims from the existing persona created during Phase 1, and our task was to
                    validate these claims by tracing them back to the original research data.</p>

                        and motivations.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>For my assigned claims, I analyzed interview and survey responses to identify evidence that supported
                    or contradicted these statements. I documented each finding with its source, ensuring the persona
                    was grounded in real user feedback. I clarified key use goals and frustrations, which were integral
                    to refining the persona and ensuring it was researched-backed and actionable. </p>

                </figure>
                <img loading="lazy" src="assets/images/dfn/persona.png" alt="Validating claims">
                <p>This refined persona, a result of the validated research, served as a critical tool for planning and
                    conducting usability testing in this phase, while also informing future design decisions. </p>
                <h3>2. Survey creation and outreach</h3>
                <p>In Phase 1, initial surveys were drafted and deployed to explore user needs and experiences with
                    dyslexia, targeting parents/students and educators. In Phase 2, we expanded on this work, refining
                    the surveys to gather deeper, more actionable insights. This included revising existing questions,
                    restructuring the format, and preparing the surveys for usability test participants and further
                    research responses.</p>
                <p>Each team member was assigned questions to refine, omit, or expand upon, and the examples above
                    highlight my contributions. </p>
                <p> During the revision process, I focused on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rewording open-ended questions to include clear options and examples, ensuring participants
                        could provide more focused and relevant responses.
                    </li>
                    <li>Transforming broad or ambiguous questions into targeted, multiple-choice formats to streamline
                        data collection and enable more effective analysis of results. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Simplifying and clarifying question wording to make the survey more inclusive and understandable
                        for all participants, while aligning responses with research goals to gather meaningful insights
                        into user behaviors. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once individual revisions were complete, we collaborated as a team to <b>review and iterate.</b> We
                    provided
                    feedback on one another’s work and voted on which responses to include in the final surveys. These
                    refinements not only optimized the surveys for participants but improved the quality of insights
                    gathered, enabling a deeper understanding of user needs and behaviors to guide future design
                    decisions.</p>
                <h3>3. Usability test planning and creation</h3>
                <p>During this sprint, our team reviewed and collaborated to provide feedback on the wireframes for the
                    UX design team. Part of this process included adding comments directly on the prototype, identifying
                    areas that could be clarified or improved. </p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="assets/images/dfn/wireframecomments.png" alt="Wireframe comments">
                <p> The visual above highlights some of <b>my specific comments and suggestions,</b> including
                    recommendations
                    to simplify menu options for consistency and reduce potential confusion with terms like “points” and
                    “coins.”
                </p>
                <p>Alongside commenting on the prototype, we worked as a team to <b>develop usability test questions</b>
                    to
                    assess how users interact with the prototype and their overall experience with the interface. After
                    brainstorming and pitching questions, we voted to determine which would be most effective for the
                    usability test. 
                </p>
                <p>Once the questions were finalized, we compiled them into a logical sequence, aligning them with
                    specific usability tasks that participants would complete during the test. We also created pre-test
                    questions to gather information about participants’ access to technology at home and school, their
                    familiarity with dyslexia apps and games, and their age. Post-test questions were designed to
                    evaluate participants’ impressions of the app, their overall experience, and if they would like to
                    take part in future usability tests.
                </p>
                <h3>4. Synthesizing research insights</h3>
                <p> After conducting usability tests with 6 educators and 6 students, each team member was assigned two
                    test recordings to review and take detailed notes. We documented key observations on Miro, with each
                    sticky note color corresponding to a specific participant. This ensured that feedback and findings
                    were clearly associated with individual users while maintaining consistency across the team.
                </p>
                <p>Once all notes were documented, we collaboratively transferred the sticky notes into sections for
                    each usability task. This allowed us to identify patterns and themes for every task by grouping
                    feedback from different participants. The visual above demonstrates how feedback from multiple users
                    was aggregated and organized by task to create a summary of key insights.
                </p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="assets/images/dfn/researchaggregation.png" alt="Research aggregation">
                <p>This synthesis process was the final task in Phase 2, and the aggregated findings were handed off to
                    the Phase 3 team to inform further design decisions and iterations.</p>
                <h3>5. Ongoing tasks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Working sessions
                    </li>
                    <li>Stand-up meetings with other teams (UX design, UX writing)
                    </li>
                    <li>Drafting outreach invitations to potential partner organizations
                    </li>
                    <li>Individual research efforts (on Dyslexia, parter organizations, reviewing the prior phase’s
                        work)
                    </li>
                    <li>Updating the shared Notion and Figjam.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Takeaways</h2>
                <p> This project showed me the importance of collaboration and iteration in UX research. Revising the
                    surveys taught me how small changes, like improving clarity and accessibility, can significantly
                    enhance the quality of data collected. Synthesizing usability test findings deepened my
                    understanding of how to organize and compare feedback effectively to identify meaningful patterns. 
                </p>
                <p> The individual contributions and collaborative efforts from each member highlighted the importance
                    of teamwork in creating a cohesive research process. Ultimately, the insights we uncovered provided
                    a solid foundation for Phase 3, ensuring the next team could build on clearly defined user needs and
                    actionable themes.
