                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>The Donovan’s Piano Room (TDPR) is a virtual music education platform offering lessons in piano,
                    voice, and guitar. Through games, video lessons, and interactive books, the program aims to make
                    music education accessible, engaging, and comprehensive for children of all ages.</p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Without clear, accessible information about TDPR’s offerings, parents may hesitate to enroll their
                    children. To address this, the platform must make critical details easily available and communicate
                    its value effectively. Additionally, to resonate with both parents and children, TDPR’s content must
                    be engaging, accessible, and clearly structured, balancing a playful tone that appeals to children
                    with a professional tone that builds trust with parents.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Conducted with six participants who navigated the live website and walked through the sign-up
                        flow.
                    </li>
                    <li>Participants were selected based on specific criteria, including having children aged 12 or
                        younger with an interest in music, to ensure alignment with TDPR’s target audience.
                    </li>
                    <li>Participants explored the website naturally and shared their first impressions, particularly
                        focusing on their decision-making as parents seeking online music education.
                    </li>

                <h2>Key Findings and Recommendations</h2>
                <h3>1. Initial impressions and Branding</h3>
                <h4>Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The platform’s name, “The Donovan’s Piano Room,” led participants to believe it only offered
                        piano lessons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Participants appreciated the playful design but noted a lack of critical information about the
                        program’s scope.
                    </li>
                    <li>Parents expected to see multiple testimonials but found only one on the homepage.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rename the platform to “The Donovan’s Music Room” and add a tagline to showcase all instrument
                        offered for instruction. This rebranding better communicates the platform’s broader offerings,
                        addressing user misconceptions that the program is limited to piano lessons. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Include a dedicated testimonials section, showcasing diverse success stories for each
                        instrument.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add a homepage banner with images of students playing different instruments to visually
                        communicate the program’s offerings.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>2. Navigation and Curriculum Information</h3>
                <h4>Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many sections, such as “Live Lessons” and “Program,” lacked detailed content, leading to
                        frustration.
                    </li>
                    <li>Parents were unclear about the structure of lessons (e.g., live vs. self-paced).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create instrument-specific sections within the “Program” page, detailing lesson methods and
                        engagement strategies.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add an interactive curriculum map to break down the learning journey, allowing parents to
                        explore lesson modules and teaching methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensure all navigation links are functional and guide users to relevant content.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </figure>
                <h3>3. Student Engagement and Interactive Features</h3>
                <h4>Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Participants expressed uncertainty about how TDPR would engage children effectively. Multiple
                        parents highlighted the lack of interactive previews or examples demonstrating the lessons,
                        games, and activities offered by the program.
                    </li>
                    <p class="center"><i>“I’m not sure how this will keep my child interested.”</i></p>
                    <p class="center"><i>“It’s hard to assess if my child would stay engaged without seeing how the
                            lessons or games
                            work.”</i></p>
                    <li>They compared the platform to others, specifically Duolingo, which provides clear previews of
                        its engagement strategies. These concerns emphasize the importance of showcasing interactive
                        elements to illustrate how the program captures and maintains children’s interest, ultimately
                        helping parents assess its alignment with their child’s needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Include sample lesson videos or screenshots to demonstrate interactive elements, such as games
                        and practice challenges.
                    </li>
                    <li>Highlight engagement features (e.g., quizzes, games) and explain how they cater to various
                        learning styles (visual, auditory, kinesthetic). On the current website, these learning methods
                        are mentioned but in a broader, more generic way that lacks specificity to TDPR’s program.
                    </li>
                    <li>Introduce a “Student Spotlight” section featuring examples of student progress and testimonials
                        to showcase how other students enjoyed the program and remained engaged. Highlighting their
                        success stories and enthusiasm can build trust and help parents visualize how the program
                        effectively works for children.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="assets/images/tdpr/agesupport.png">
                <h3>4. Age-Specific Content</h3>
                <h4>Findings</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Parents expected tailored information for different age groups (e.g., preschoolers, middle
                        schoolers) but found generic content instead.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create separate pages for each age group, detailing curriculum structures and teaching methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>Use photos or videos to showcase age-specific activities and lessons.
                    </li>
                    <li>Add testimonials that reflect the experiences of children in each age group.
                    </li>

                <h2>Homepage Redesign</h2>
                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>I redesigned the homepage to address key information and content gaps identified during user testing.
                    To help parents easily access the information needed to make informed enrollment decisions,
                    call-to-action buttons and a dropdown menu were added to guide them directly to key informational
                    pages. Some recommendations were still under review and, as a result, not all of my suggested
                    changes were incorporated into the redesign pitch.
                </p>
                <h3>Initial Design</h3>

                <h3>Key Revisions</h3>
                <h4>1. Updated Copy and Tone</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> The heading and subheading were revised to directly engage parents and children with
                        approachable yet professional language. The updates also ensured that the targeted age group,
                        instruments offered, and the holistic learning approach of TDPR were made immediately clear.
                        This was in response to user testing feedback, where parents expressed confusion about these
                        aspects of the program.

                <ul>
                    <li>Revised copy on the map to showcase key sections (Video Lessons, Games, Books). This supports
                        the program’s holistic approach by emphasizing how these elements work together to provide an
                        engaging and comprehensive learning experience, addressing user needs for clarity and cohesion.
                    </li>
                    <li>Each main section (Video Lessons, Games, Books) on the map will link to a specific page to
                        direct them to accompanying pages.

                    immediate clarity on critical information and can seamlessly navigate to additional pages for
                    further exploration. This ease of access allows users to find information more quickly, addressing
                    the needs of busy parents who may have limited time to explore their options.</p>
