        <h1>GoalPact: Empowering Goal Achievement through Accountability and Visualization</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today’s fast-paced world, it’s easy for personal goals to take a back seat to daily responsibilities.
                The
                lack
                of structured systems for accountability, clear progress tracking, and meaningful support can leave
                individuals
                feeling unmotivated and overwhelmed. Recognizing this need, I developed the concept and design for
                GoalPact,
                a
                digital platform aimed at helping users achieve their goals by integrating accountability partnerships,
                interactive progress visualization, and supportive communities. This project represents a conceptual
                exercise in
                UX design, focusing on research, wireframing, and the application of theoretical frameworks rather than
                development or prototyping.</p>

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>Prior to designing the wireframes, I conducted a user research study with 28 participants to ensure the
                app
                addressed real user needs. The insights uncovered from this study directly informed my design process
                and
                ideation, helping shape features that align with user challenges.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <h3>1. Diverse Goals</h3>
            <p>Participants valued encouragement, shared tips/resources, and progress updates within goal-specific
                communities
                but expressed mixed feelings about public engagement.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/goalpact/goals.png" />
            <h3>2. Progress Impact</h3>
            <p>All participants struggle to make progress toward their goals, and an alarming 85.8% of participants
                indicated
                that it impacts their mood and well-being.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/goalpact/impact.png" />
            <h3>3. Accountability Needs</h3>
            <p>Many participants expressed interest in forming accountability partnerships, emphasizing qualities like
                encouragement, shared interests, and regular check-ins. These insights highlight the importance of
                fostering
                meaningful, goal-oriented connections within the app.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/goalpact/needs.png" />
            <h3>4. Community Insights</h3>
            <p>Participants valued encouragement, shared tips/resources, and progress updates within goal-specific
                communities
                but expressed mixed feelings about public engagement.</p>
            <h3>5. Tool Limitations</h3>
            <p>Commonly used tools (e.g., Google Calendar, Notion) lacked interactivity and personalized support,
                underscoring
                the demand for a more integrated and intuitive platform.</p>
            <h3>6. Structured Support Preferences</h3>
            <p>Most participants preferred moderate structure when working toward goals, favoring clear guidelines but
                with
                flexibility for individual needs.</p>
            <h3>7. Celebration and Rewards</h3>
            <p>Participants emphasized the importance of recognizing milestones, with personal rewards and progress
                summaries
                being the most motivating.</p>
            <h3>8. Interest in Motivational Tools</h3>
            <p>Tools like reminders, progress visuals, and motivational quotes were frequently mentioned as desirable
                features
                to keep users engaged.</p>
            <h3>9. Participant Demographics</h3>
            <p>The research group consisted of a diverse range of participants, spanning different ages (18-55+),
                professional
                backgrounds, and personal goals. This diversity ensured comprehensive insights that shaped GoalPact’s
                inclusive
                design.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <h3>Exploration</h3>
            <p>The early design process for GoalPact involved creating low- and mid-fidelity prototypes to explore
                potential solutions:</p>
            <h3>Low-Fidelity Sketches</h3>
            <p>Initially, I planned to design only two wireframes: one for the Goal Pathway and one for the timeline.
                These sketches provided a foundation for visualizing the app's key features and focused on defining user
                flows and navigation.</p>
            <div class="imageblock">
                <img src="assets/images/goalpact/lofi1.png" />
                <img src="assets/images/goalpact/lofi2.png" />
            </div>
            <h3>Mid-Fidelity Refinement</h3>
            <p>During the mid-fidelity phase, additional ideas for features emerged beyond the original low-fidelity
                sketches of the Goal Pathway and timeline. These concepts were directly integrated into mid-fidelity
                prototypes, expanding functionality and exploring how research insights could translate into actionable
                features. The mid-fidelity prototypes refined layouts and added key elements like interactive
                milestones, buddy dashboards, and enhanced usability features that aligned with user needs.</p>
            <div class="imageblock">
                <img src="assets/images/goalpact/mifimatch.png" />
                <img src="assets/images/goalpact/mifipath.png" />
            </div>
            <div class="imageblock">
                <img src="assets/images/goalpact/mificommunity.png" />
                <img src="assets/images/goalpact/mifibuddy2.png" />
            </div>
            <div class="imageblock">
                <img src="assets/images/goalpact/mifidash2.png" />
                <img src="assets/images/goalpact/mifidash1.png" />
            </div>
            <h3>High-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>In the high-fidelity phase, I refined the visual and textual elements to align with the platform’s
                identity. The UX writing process helped me explore a brand voice that was both encouraging and
                motivational, ensuring users felt supported as they navigated their journey. Additionally, I
                incorporated colors that reflected the branding and added images to enhance engagement and create a more
                intuitive experience. These wireframes are scrollable and some buttons are active.

                <div class="imageblocktext" style="margin-right: auto;">
                    <p><b>Buddy timeline:</b> Users can view posts or updates made by their
                        accountability partners, which are
                        referred to as “buddies.” Because GoalPact encourages users to focus on current partnerships,
                        only
                        active partnerships will show up here. However, by selecting the filter icon, users can choose
                        to
                        see prior accountability partners’ posts, if both users choose to remain connected.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Community timeline:</b> Users can view posts from the community groups they are part of. By
                        selecting
                        the filter button, users can choose if they’d like to see posts from a specific community only.
                        The
                        community timeline will push content analyzed by an algorithm to ensure users see relevant
                        content
                        to their journey or preferences.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Dual Dashboards</h4>

                            Users can view their own weekly progress or their buddy’s (accountability partner) and
                            toggle between the two with ease.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Specific CTAs at the bottom of each dashboard encourage users to either engage with their
                            accountability partner or update/interact with their own goals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The gauge charts allow users to visualize their progress for the week, paired with icons
                            next to
                            each step showcasing their status.
                        </li>
                        <li> Because users may be pursuing multiple goals, they can scroll down and see an additional
                            goal,
                            hence “goal category 1.”

                    <p>The Goal Pathway allows users to visualize their journey in a fun and engaging manner. Think of
                        the
                        yellow brick road from MGM’s The Wizard of Oz (1939). In this case, users unlock coloring of the
                        path they’ve completed, while the rest remains in grayscale until they reach each goal point.

            <h2>Theoretical Foundations</h3>
                <p>The design of GoalPact was heavily informed by Common Bond/Identity Theory and Amy Jo Kim's Nine
                    Principles of Community Design. Common Bond Theory shaped the accountability partnership features,
                    emphasizing close interpersonal connections through shared goals and consistent check-ins.
                    Simultaneously, Common Identity Theory inspired the community feed, fostering a sense of belonging
                    through shared challenges and collaborative progress. Amy Jo Kim's principles guided the app's
                    structure, particularly through clear purpose, evolving user profiles, and gathering spaces like the
                    buddy and community feeds. These frameworks ensured that GoalPact not only addressed user needs but
                    also
                    created a meaningful and supportive ecosystem for goal achievement.</p>

            <h2>GoalPact's Edge</h2>
            <p>GoalPact offers a more comprehensive, interactive, and personalized experience.</p>
            <h4>GoalPact...</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Prioritizes peer-based accountability through partnerships that foster meaningful connections.</li>
                <li>Encourages collaboration through shared dashboards and non-competitive motivation.</li>
                <li>Breaks down complex, long-term objectives into manageable milestones with our engaging visualization
                    pathway.</li>
                <li>Provides tools for sustained progress, combining individualized support with the option to engage in
                    community groups.</li>
                <li>Creates a holistic, user-centered experience that empowers users to stay motivated and connected to
                    their
                    goals. </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <h4>Potential Harms</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Social comparisons on traditional platforms can reduce motivation and well-being by emphasizing
                    unattainable standards. (Meier & Johnson, 2022).</li>
                <li>Overly idealized content can overwhelm users, leading to feelings of inadequacy and discouragement
                    (Meier et
                    al., 2020).</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>How GoalPact Addresses These:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Focuses on personal progress and growth through customizable visualization pathways, forming
                    communities,
                    and accountability partnerships.</li>
                <li>Community spaces are designed for sharing advice and resources, not wins or losses, minimizing
                    comparison-driven envy.</li>
                <li>Spreads encouraging reminders throughout the app to speak to how everyone’s journey is different and
                    not
                    always linear.</li>
                <li>Users are in charge of the content they seek out, such as viewing others’ profiles and looking at
                    their
                    completed pathways/accomplishments.</li>
                <li>Emphasize to users that viewing others’ pathways is meant to give users ideas on how they can
                    outline their own journey, and is not meant to be displayed or viewed in a competitive manner.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>Working on GoalPact allowed me to explore how user research and theoretical frameworks shape meaningful
                design. Insights from diverse participants, such as the need for accountability and motivational tools,
                guided key features like the Goal Pathway and dashboards. The iterative design process expanded my
                understanding of how features can holistically address user pain points, while UX writing and branding
                refined the experience to feel supportive and engaging. By applying frameworks like Common Bond/Identity
                Theory and Amy Jo Kim’s principles, I ensured the platform fostered both individual connections and a
                sense of community. This process deepened my skills in research-driven design and reinforced my passion
                for creating impactful user experiences.</p>
